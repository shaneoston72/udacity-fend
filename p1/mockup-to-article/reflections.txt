Web development is a wondrous, engaging domain, one which I am quite excited to be a
part. Since I embarked on my formal training in this exciting field, I have learned
the following:

* The principle languages used to create the modern web (HTML 5, CSS 5, and
JavaScript).
* Object-oriented programming concepts.
* OOP in Ruby.
* Web application development in Sinatra.
* Web application development in Rails.

I come to my training with a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. These aspects of
web development come easiest to me. The difficulty I have experienced thus far is
the way to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to develop compelling
products. My training at Udacity is meant to fill the gaps in my present
knowledge.

I have relied on my escalation process as outlined in the first project to
research new technologies, unfamiliar tags, and bugs. For instance, I used
Google to find how to superscript text in HTML.
