Project Instructions

1. Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip from the downloadables section. You'll find index.html, the article mockup image (blog-mockup.png) and a file called reflections.txt inside.
2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough.")
3. When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in reflections.txt. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
