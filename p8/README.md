# Project Overview

This is the final project of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.  It is meant to show familiarity with Test-Driven Development and Unit Testing using Jasmine.

## Instructions to use
Download or clone the repository.  Run index.html through a local web server or open the file directly.  You see the tests response at the bottom of the app.

## Tests
Tests are found in ```jasmine/spec/```.  Feel free to change tests to see them fail or add additional tests.  If you'd like to add a test to the repository, create a pull request.
